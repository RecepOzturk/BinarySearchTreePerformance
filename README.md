The project has two type of binary search. Firstly, classical Binary Search Tree which has left and right chil and parent node.
Secondly, we have Augmented Binary Search Tree which each node holds number and a HOLDER. Holder means, EACH NODE HOLDS SUM OF THE NUMBER SMALLER NODES.

We Compare the two tree;

-insertion time

-Time; GET SUM SMALLER for the item with value 1000

-Time; summation of all items.

- Deletion time of all items.


*Each tree has the same 1000 number
